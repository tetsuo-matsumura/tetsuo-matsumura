I am an **Engineering Manager** with experience working with companies of all sizes, particularly in fast-paced **startups** and **edtechs**.

I am proficient in **Javascript**, **React** plus the associated toolkit. I pride myself on putting people first and effective communication. My main mission is to share knowledge and promote a healthy work-life balance.

Throughout my career, I have helped teams deliver high-quality products and services through my technical expertise and leadership skills.

In addition to my work as an Engineering Manager, I am a Fullstack Development Bootcamp Teacher and I have a passion for teaching and mentoring developers. I have successfully coached over 200 developers into the IT market and am dedicated to helping others grow their skills and advance their careers.

In my spare time, I also enjoy giving free programming classes to help individuals get started in the field or take their skills to the next level. My love for teaching and sharing knowledge extends beyond my professional roles and I am always looking for ways to give back to the community.

I am excited to continue learning and collaborating with others on exciting projects. Thank you for visiting my profile.
